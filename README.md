# Food-Seeking-AI
Developed the MBPTT algorithm to enhance handling long-term dependencies in AI models. This integration of memory with BPTT improved decision-making quality and reinforcement signals.  Key Contributions: Enhanced AI model performance in tasks requiring long-term dependency management.

Food-Seeking Task Using Memory-Augmented BPTT
Summary: Applied memory-augmented BPTT to a simulated food-seeking task. Evaluated the algorithm's effectiveness in replicating behaviours indicative of functional sentience and environmental mapping.

Key Contributions: Assessed the potential of BPTT in tasks mimicking natural behaviours.
